#vapetemp

python code for raspberian jessie to record temperatures and heater light cycles on a dry herb vaporizer



*History*

Started early january 2016, developing a vaporizer temperature probe system
started out with the adafruit sample for my max31855
added a stripchart and changed to spi

feb 15 2016 Bondi,
added a blinken light line - just faked as 20 or 25c
assumed off when reading is > 5000 - typically 30k if off and the
blu-tac holds. 
Also finally got it working without the horror of being root to get
gpio access via /dev/mem or dev/spidev..

run something like this:
---------
#!/bin/bash
ross feb 15 2016 fix so pi can access /dev/mem for gpio and /dev/spi...
see  http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/40105/access-gpio-pins-without-root-no-access-to-dev-mem-try-running-as-root
sudo chown `id -u`.`id -g` /dev/spidev0.*
sudo chown root.gpio /dev/gpiomem
sudo chmod g+rw /dev/gpiomem
sudo chown `id -u`.`id -g` /dev/spidev0.*

jan 8 no graphics from matplotlib?
update to jessie and beware that if you use apt-get install python-matplotlib,
mathplotlib may (still) be defaulting to the wrong
device - if matplotlib.get_backend() doesn't return u'TkAgg' then you
might need to update to the git matplotlib repo - worked for me

using wheezy, access to gpio was via /dev/mem so required root
I noted:
jan 6 might need to use pigpio for non sudo running
see http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html
MUST start with
sudo pigpiod
