##What it does
Python code for raspberian jessie to record temperatures and heater light
flashes on a dry herb vaporizer

See the obs directory for some typical outputs from an Arizer Solo 
:)

Here's a typical run with two inhalations. 

The temperature is recorded with a cheap thermocouple inside a packed stem (ABV
to protect the experimenter) and mounted upside down so convection is minimised
unless an inhalation takes place.
 

Periods where the heater light blinked are identified by a photoresistor sampled to give 
the lower blue waveform - when it's at 25, the light was on for part of the second, otherwise
it's at 20, so it shows when the Solo heater was in play. 

The solo is upside down to minimise convection unless inhalation is going on. For the first few 
minutes, it's left alone so the already warm device seems to settle down
at around 140C - the stem is slightly pulled back from it's deepest insertion point.
 
After each inhalation starts, the heater kicks in - the first one is interesting
because the Solo had just finished heating when I started inhaling so it took a while 
before it started cycling again.

##Hardware
This is for the optional photoresistor sensor
https://www.adafruit.com/products/161 stuck using
blu-tac to monitor the "heating" red blinking light on the device
adjust to suit the gpio pin you've wired your
photoresistor to. I'm using a photoresistor on gpio 4
with a capacitor using a loop to count charge
which is inverse to photocell illumination level.
mine gives below 5000 when the red light blinks on
and 20000+ when off using blu-tac. Idea and design from
https://learn.adafruit.com/basic-resistor-sensor-reading-on-raspberry-pi/basic-photocell-reading


##Recommended
In order NOT to have to run the code as root, there's a problem with jessie raspbian as of now
that you need to fix. To do that you need to run something like this:

```
 #!/bin/bash
 # ross feb 15 2016 fix so pi can access /dev/mem for gpio and /dev/spi...
 # see  http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/40105/access-gpio-pins-without-root-no-access-to-dev-mem-try-running-as-root
 sudo chown `id -u`.`id -g` /dev/spidev0.*
 sudo chown root.gpio /dev/gpiomem
 sudo chmod g+rw /dev/gpiomem
 sudo chown `id -u`.`id -g` /dev/spidev0.*
```


#Development History
Started early january 2016, developing a vaporizer temperature probe system
started out with the adafruit sample for my max31855
added a stripchart and changed to spi

feb 15 2016 Bondi,
added a blinken light line - just faked as 20 or 25c
assumed off when reading is > 5000 - typically 30k if off and the
blu-tac holds. 
Also finally got it working without the horror of being root to get
gpio access via /dev/mem or dev/spidev..

jan 8 no graphics from matplotlib?
update to jessie and beware that if you use apt-get install python-matplotlib,
mathplotlib may (still) be defaulting to the wrong
device - if matplotlib.get_backend() doesn't return u'TkAgg' then you
might need to update to the git matplotlib repo - worked for me

using wheezy, access to gpio was via /dev/mem so required root
I noted:
jan 6 might need to use pigpio for non sudo running
see http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html
MUST start with
sudo pigpiod
